# Graphonomous Workflows

End-to-end recipes for common tasks. Pick the workflow that matches your situation.

## Arguments

Workflow type: $ARGUMENTS

## Cold Start (empty graph)
1. `retrieve_context(query: "project overview")` — confirm empty
2. `manage_goal(operation: "create_goal", payload: {"title": "Orient on project", "horizon": "short"})`
3. Explore code/docs → `store_node` for each key finding (one atomic fact per node)
4. Link nodes with `store_edge` where relationships improve retrieval
5. `manage_goal(operation: "set_progress", goal_id: "<id>", progress: 0.5)`
6. `run_consolidation(action: "run_and_status", wait_ms: 2000)`

## Warm Resume (existing knowledge)
1. `manage_goal(operation: "list_goals", filters: {"status": "active"})`
2. `attention_survey(include_idle: false)`
3. Pick top attention item or follow user request
4. `retrieve_context(query: "<current topic>")`
5. Continue working with context, saving `causal_context`

## Answer a Question
1. `retrieve_context(query: "<the question>")` — save `causal_context`
2. Check `topology.routing` — if `"deliberate"`, run `deliberate(query: "...")`
3. Answer using retrieved knowledge + current conversation
4. `store_node(node_type: "semantic", content: "<synthesized answer>", source: "conversation")`
5. If user confirms → `learn_from_outcome(status: "success", causal_node_ids: [...])`

## Explore a Codebase
1. Create parent goal: `manage_goal(operation: "create_goal", payload: {"title": "Explore <repo>"})`
2. Create sub-goals per module (3–6), each with `parent_goal_id`
3. For each module: explore → `store_node` per finding → `store_edge` for cross-module relationships
4. `manage_goal(operation: "link_nodes", ...)` — link findings to sub-goals
5. `manage_goal(operation: "set_progress", ...)` after each module
6. `review_goal` on parent when all sub-goals done

## Debug a Problem
1. `retrieve_context(query: "prior context on <issue>")` — save `causal_context`
2. Isolate the issue using retrieved context
3. Test fix
4. `store_node(node_type: "episodic", content: "<what happened and what fixed it>")`
5. `learn_from_outcome(status: "success"|"failure", causal_node_ids: [...])` with real IDs
6. Link to goal if applicable

## Resolve Contradictions
1. Detect: `retrieve_context` returns nodes with `contradicts` edges, or `routing: "deliberate"`
2. Diagnose: `topology_analyze(query: "<topic>")` — examine SCCs and fault-line edges
3. Deliberate: `deliberate(query: "<the contradiction>", write_back: true)`
4. Verify: `topology_analyze` again — confirm κ decreased
5. Store resolution as semantic node if not already written back

## Ralph Loop (autonomous iteration)
1. `attention_survey` → pick top item
2. `retrieve_context` for that goal — save `causal_context`
3. Act on it
4. `learn_from_outcome(...)` with real causal IDs
5. `review_goal` → follow act/learn/escalate decision
6. Advance to next attention item
7. Repeat; `run_consolidation` every 4–5 cycles

## Maintenance
1. `run_consolidation(action: "run_and_status", wait_ms: 2000)`
2. `manage_goal(operation: "list_goals")` — review all goals
3. Re-review any active goals near completion thresholds
4. Transition stale goals to `suspended` or `abandoned` with metadata

## Teach a Domain
1. `manage_goal(operation: "create_goal", payload: {"title": "Learn <domain>"})`
2. User provides info → `store_node` for each fact/procedure
3. `store_edge` to connect related concepts
4. `manage_goal(operation: "link_nodes", ...)` — link all nodes to goal
5. Build out recursively until coverage review returns `act`

## Multi-Agent Handoff
1. Prepare state snapshot: `manage_goal(operation: "list_goals")`
2. For each active goal: `manage_goal(operation: "get_goal", goal_id: "<id>")`
3. Include linked nodes, progress, outcomes, and coverage state
4. Recipient resumes with `/graphonomous:bootstrap` to load context

## End of Session
1. Store pending knowledge via `store_node`
2. Report outcomes via `learn_from_outcome`
3. Update goal progress/status via `manage_goal`
4. `run_consolidation(action: "run_and_status", wait_ms: 2000)`
